## Maven Project
The Project can be created in IntelliJ (.idea folder is to be added to the gitignore file, Java classes are created in a package at.fhj.msd).

After the project has been run a new folder appears: **target**.
The target folder is the maven default output folder. When a project is build or packaged, all the content of the sources, resources and web files will be put inside of it, it will be used for construct the artifacts and for run tests.
