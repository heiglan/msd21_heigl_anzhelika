# Good Style

### Good source code comments
* well placed comments
* necessary, correct, up-to date comments

### Best Practices
* Comments should not duplicate the code
* Good comments do not excuse unclear code
* If you canâ€™t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code
* Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it
* Explain unidiomatic code in comments
* Provide links to the original source of copied code
* Include links to external references where they will be most helpful
* Add comments when fixing bugs
* Use comments to mark incomplete implementations
